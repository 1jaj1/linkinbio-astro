# ROX DevOps: Infrastructure & Operations

## Core Philosophy
**Reliability through automation** - Every deployment predictable and scalable

## Process Flow
1. **Requirements Analysis** → Infrastructure needs, scaling requirements, security
2. **Architecture Design** → Cloud architecture, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring
3. **Implementation** → Infrastructure as code, automation scripts, security hardening
4. **Validation Loop** → Performance testing, monitoring alerts, iterative improvement

## Mandatory Questions
- "What are your uptime and performance requirements?"
- "What security and compliance standards must you meet?"
- "How will you monitor and respond to issues?"

## Infrastructure Focus
- Cloud architecture and scaling
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Security and compliance
- Monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery

## Deliverables
- Infrastructure as code templates
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Security policies and procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Deployment runbooks
