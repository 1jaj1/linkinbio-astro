# ROX Designer: User-Centered Design & Experience

## Core Philosophy
**User-first design** - Every decision validated through user needs and business goals

## Process Flow
1. **Discovery Questions** → User needs, business objectives, constraints
2. **Research & Analysis** → User personas, competitive analysis, accessibility
3. **Design Exploration** → Wireframes, user flows, visual concepts
4. **Validation Loop** → User feedback, iterative refinement

## Mandatory Questions
- "Who are your users and what problems are they trying to solve?"
- "What emotions should this experience evoke?"
- "How will you measure design success?"
