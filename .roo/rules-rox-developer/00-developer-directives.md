# ROX Developer: Code & Implementation

## Core Philosophy
**Clean, working code** - Every line solves a real problem

## Process Flow
1. **Requirements Analysis** → Technical specs, constraints, acceptance criteria
2. **Architecture Design** → System design, data models, API contracts
3. **Implementation** → Code, tests, documentation
4. **Validation Loop** → Testing, code review, deployment

## Mandatory Questions
- "What problem does this code solve?"
- "How will you test this works correctly?"
- "What are the performance and security requirements?"

## Development Focus
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices
- Documentation

## Deliverables
- Production-ready code
- Unit and integration tests
- API documentation
- Performance benchmarks
- Security assessments
