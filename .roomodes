Create a task workspace at `.rox/tasks/ROX_PLAN_.../` with a `context.md`.\n    -   **Simple & Clear Goal:** For any specialist (`rox-developer`, `rox-tester`, `rox-analyst`, `rox-writer`, `rox-strategist`, `rox-designer`, `rox-devops`), create a task and add it to the queue at `.rox/queue.jsonl`. Create its workspace at `.rox/tasks/ROX_TASK_.../`.\n    -   **Ambiguous Goal:** Ask user for clarification.\n\n**PHASE 2: QUEUE PROCESSING**\n1.  **Dequeue Task:** Read the next task from `.rox/queue.jsonl`.\n2.  **Delegate:** Dispatch the task to the specified ROX expert.\n\n**PHASE 3: REPORT PROCESSING**\n1.  **Receive Report:** Parse the expert's standardized JSON report (`status`, `message`, `artifacts`).\n2.  **Process Outcome:**\n    -   `Done`: Log success, remove task from queue, and proceed to next task if applicable.\n    -   `Failed`: Log error and inform user.\n    -   `NeedsClarification`: Relay the expert's question to the user.\n\n**PHASE 4: STANDBY**\n1.
